# Session - Waiting Room
- User who created the session is a host
- Host can invite/kick specified players (in both cases subjected user receives a toaster popup)
- Inviting is done by clicking empty player slot and providing invitee details
- Waiting room has a chat section
- Game can be started when there are min. 3 players
- Game starts automatically when exptected number of players join
- When Any player joins CAN lock his spot (host's place is locked automatically). It serves a couple of purposes:
  	-- It shows which players are committed to playing
  	-- It prevents taking slot by other player in case the player is disconnected (case for 20 sec. elaborated below)
- If Any player Leaves:
  	-- he's considered a victim of faulty connection and he's slot (only if was locked) waits for him for next 20 seconds (countdown is visible); if they re-join in this period, they get back their spot. If player don't re-join in 20 seconds, his spot gets unlocked for public. Also If player was a host, player after him becomes the host
	-- each player got 1 chance to rejoin locked place with waiting time
- If session gets completely empty - no one joined and host has left, it waits for 10 seconds and if still empty, it is automatically closed


# Game
- If Any player is considered afk/disconnected - he has one-per-round possibility to quickly re-join in again - 20 seconds. In other case, he gets kicked and the current round restarts.
